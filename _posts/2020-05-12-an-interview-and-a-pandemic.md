Before the pandemic, I was interviewed for my new role and I described how the world might look for the future from a data perspective.

In it I described a world in the PowerPoint where it would be more data driven for the place I worked, and how we would aim to work with our partners to achieve objectives for the social good in an Office of Data Analytics. Data would find it’s place as valuable for what it told us.

We’d never have to prove a financial case for the use of data, as what it may reveal in of itself was the value case.

There's a secondary point as well which is working in Local Government, if we considered perfect financial conditions, care in most instances would almost always be provided by people, and we would still choose to optimise systems for efficiency. As there's an imperative to deliver value for money. But perhaps that's a discussion for another post!

Of one of the points I described, was in regards to outliers, that they aren't statistically cold in our business, and outliers matter. That we may need to run whole teams on working on outlier events could be likely. The best example I could think of in mid-February was snow.

## No business like snow business

When we think of snow that settles as a local authority, or as a Warwickshire resident, it's not the most common type of weather we would expect to get across any given year (or across several years), snow that settles in the county has effects that can result in outlier behaviour across the entire population, and can put a strain on services we deliver in almost all areas. 

Virtual Network traffic will spike immediately, in a way we should expect but are always surprised by as people decide it's unsafe to drive into work and work remotely. Schools (and more importantly parents and children) are refreshing the school opens list to see if they are going to be attending school in person.

Looking at other critical services, we may see strain on the Fire Service reaching people in emergency situations possibly due to the road network. For people that may be vulnerable or at risk, there become greater concerns in attending in need due to physical access.

## Pandemics will break them all

Whilst I might draw comparisons between the issues we might face with an outlier scenario such as snow, pandemics have clearly shown themselves to be the outlier to rule all others.

The effects of this have systematically changed every service we deliver, every interaction we have with one another, and they've highlighted flaws in the systems.

But my hope is that with our work and efforts it presents a radical shift; an opportunity to build back better.
