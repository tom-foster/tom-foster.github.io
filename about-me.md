title: About me
subtitle: Digital and Data expert
---

I've worked in the public sector predominantly most of my working life, with a bit of a spell in the private sector running my own business, and advising others.

I enjoy the areas I work in and I do value delivering social value through doing good things. I love tricky complicated challenges.

From time to time though I occassionally like to work on my own projects, whether for fun or commercial reasons.

I probably never got the most from the education system like I should have but I am a life long learner. It's fair to say I'm very broad technically now, and not too bad on applied data ethics, legislation and governance either.

My work experience though has meant that I've got depth and breadth of experience in:
- Digital
    - Full stack development
    - Test Driven Development
    - User Experience
    - Strategy and roadmapping
    - Project management
- Data
    - Applied ethics
    - Data science
    - Visualisation
    - Strategy and roadmapping
    - Project management and delivery lead

I also have a bizarre amount of experience in branding for some reason.

Ideally looking to set up a couple of small businesses that run themselves, I have a pang sometimes to work for myself again but at the moment it's not a pressing priority, but I'm open to opportunities as and when they come.

Future near-time goals would be looking to become a Chief Data Officer, and side hustles!

Oh and this website might turn into a blog I just haven't decided yet. ðŸ¤”

<!-- ### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions. -->
