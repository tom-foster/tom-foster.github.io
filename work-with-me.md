## What I'm looking for

I'm currently available for consultancy/contract work on a short term basis, (31 days a year). If the projects are interesting enough, I would consider longer term contracts.

I'm ideally looking for board/director level roles where advisement is needed in the use of data.

## Would I be right for you?

If you're looking to take advantage of the gains in either digital technology, or data for competitive advantage, both in the short and long term I'm probably the right short term hire.

You'll get someone who can get up to speed quickly with your business and set your vision on the right tracks.
